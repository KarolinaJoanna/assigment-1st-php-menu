Assigment 1st
WE are building a menu in php using DW and github for storage and edition.
Little style with css – base it dosnt have to be enchanting
Use php for not reapeting all commands on evry page f.e : 
   <?php
    include 'menu.php'
    ?>
 
    <?php
      require'footer.php';
?>
Remember about KISS > keep it simple and stupid
